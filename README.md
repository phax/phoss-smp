phoss SMP is a complete SMP server that supports both the Peppol SMP 1.x specification as well as the OASIS BDXR SMP 1.0 and 2.0 specifications.
It comes with a management GUI and an XML, SQL or MongoDB backend for simplified operations.  

It was the first SMP to be [CEF eDelivery conformant](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/DIGITAL/OASIS+SMP+conformant+solutions).

This project is part of my Peppol solution stack. See https://github.com/phax/peppol for other components and libraries in that area.

Latest version: **[8.1.0](https://github.com/phax/phoss-smp/releases/tag/phoss-smp-parent-pom-8.1.0)** (2026-02-24).
See the special [Migrations guide](https://github.com/phax/phoss-smp/wiki/Migrations) for actions necessary on updates/version changes.

Docker containers can be found, depending on the backend you want to use:
* https://hub.docker.com/r/phelger/phoss-smp-xml/tags (same as https://hub.docker.com/r/phelger/smp/tags)
